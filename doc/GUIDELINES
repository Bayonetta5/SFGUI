1. INTRODUCTION

This file gives information about some code guidelines for the SFGUI project.
The main reason is to keep the code style and behaviour of the whole library as
consistent as possible.


2. CODE STYLE

Check the sources of SFGUI to see how code is formatted. Formatting code is
like a religion for programmers, but please stick to SFGUI's style if you're
about to contribute source code.


3. GENERAL RULES

  1. No definitions in class declarations: Do not define something within a
     class declaration. That includes methods: Even if they're short, do not
     auto-inline by defining it.

     NO:
     class Foo {
       void Bar() { ... }
     };

     YES:
     class Foo {
       void Bar();
     };

  2. Pay attention at const-correct method signatures. Getters mostly return
     const references â€” an exception are built-in C++ types like int, char etc.

     NO:
     sf::String GetText();

     YES:
     const sf::String& GetText() const;

  3. Use clear and full names, especially for method names.

     NO:
     void SetPos();

     YES:
     void SetPosition();

  4. Always use new-style casts. Avoid reinterpret_cast and const_cast whenever
     possible.

     NO:
     float foo = (float)4;

     YES:
     float foo = static_cast<float>( 4 );
