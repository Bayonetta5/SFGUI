SFGUI -- GUI library for SFML 2

IMPORTANT: SFGUI is heavily under development, so this ReadMe is neither
complete nor very useful. Keep in mind that code which is actively being
developed may fail on your system or behave strangely.

1. Installing

Dependencies:
	- SFML 2 (http://sfml-dev.org/)
		There's currently no SFML 2 release, therefore you need to build from the
		sources (use the public SVN repository).
	- Boost (http://boost.org/)
		In detail: Smart pointers, non-copyable, any, pointer lists, signals2,
		bind, function.

The current build system in use is SCons (http://scons.org/). It's available
for all major platforms.

To build the library together with the samples, just invoke

	scons

at SFGUI's root directory. The SFGUI lib is saved to lib/, the samples to
samples/bin/. Installing the library isn't implemented at the moment, so be
sure to copy the shared library to the proper place (or use LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
-L for Linux/GCC).

If you're using Code::Blocks, then you may want to test the experimental
support for it. To create a project file, invoke

	scons codeblocks=1

Thereafter open the project which is located in build/codeblocks/SFGUI.cbp.

2. Contributing/Contact

Since SFGUI is true Open Source software, any help is greatly appreciated.
However tasks should be coordinated, which works best in IRC. Join #sfml at
irc.boxbox.org.

Otherwise check the list of developers in the CONTRIB file to get some e-mail
addresses.
